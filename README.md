# Cardiovascular Disease Analysis

## Overview
This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization for cardiovascular disease prediction using R. The dataset used is `cardio_train.csv`, and the analysis focuses on identifying key health indicators linked to cardiovascular disease.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following R libraries installed:

```R
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "glmnet", "randomForest", "xgboost",
                   "cluster", "factoextra", "ggplot2", "kableExtra", "DescTools",
                   "corrplot", "ggpubr", "tibble", "recipes", "rpart.plot", "ROSE", "gridExtra"))




Usage
Load the script in RStudio or any R-compatible environment.

Ensure cardio_train.csv is available in the specified directory.

Run the script sequentially to clean data, engineer features, and perform EDA.
